/**
 * Officially, the NTSC versions are American English only, while the PAL
 * versions support British English, French, German, Italian and Spanish, and
 * the Japanese version is Japanese only. However all versions actually have
 * support for all 7 languages, despite some being inaccessible and not even
 * translated.
 *
 * All strings are categorised into areas, which we call banks. There is one
 * bank per stage, as well as some common banks such as menus and weapon names.
 * Each bank contains 7 files; one for each translation.
 *
 * An example language filename is LoptionsE. "options" is the bank name, and E
 * means it's the American English file.
 *
 * The list of suffixes are:
 * E - American English
 * J - Japanese
 * P - British English (P is for PAL)
 * _str_f = French
 * _str_g = German
 * _str_i = Italian
 * _str_s = Spanish
 *
 * Banks are loaded based on the current stage. When loading a bank, only the
 * current translation is loaded.
 *
 * Text is referenced using a 16 bit text ID. The text ID is made up of a 7-bit
 * bank index and a 9-bit string index within that bank:
 *
 *     bbbbbbbs ssssssss
 *
 * For versions prior to PAL, the language files are loaded during stage load
 * and allocated from memp. This method doesn't work for PAL because PAL
 * supports changing the language mid-stage and memp allocations cannot be freed
 * until a new stage is loaded. So for PAL, during stage load a single buffer is
 * allocated from memp to hold all loaded language files. The buffer is
 * repopulated when the language is changed, and the lang banks point to their
 * relevant offsets within that buffer.

/**
 * Resolve a text ID to a string.
 *
 * g_LangBanks is an array of pointers to language file data in RAM. Many of
 * those pointers will be NULL because only the necessary language files are
 * loaded at any given time.
 *
 * The language file data consists of a variable-length array of offsets into
 * the file. Not to be confused with pointers.
