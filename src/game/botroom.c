/**
 * Find a position inside the given room and populate the pointer arguments with
 * information about the position.
 *
 * Used by bots in King of the Hill scenarios only. The room argument is always
 * a hill room.
 *
 * @bug: There is a possible array overflow in both the covernums and padnums
 * arrays. The for loops stop when the array is full, but the outer loop makes
 * them iterate again, and the check is only at the end of each for loop rather
 * than at the start.
 *
 * For covernums, the three variables declared above it are never written to the
 * stack, so the outer loop would need to iterate three times while covernums is
 * full in order to write into the caller's stack space. The only caller is
 * botTickUnpaused, and its first stack usage is 0x20 where it backs up s0.
 * So the outer loop would need to iterate 11 times before any damage could be
 * done.
 *
 * For padnums, any overflow will write into the rooms array, likely clearing
 * the -1 terminator in rooms[1] and affecting cover selection. Further
 * iterations of the outer loop would write into the cover struct, but this is
 * written before it's read so there's no issue there.
 *
 * It's likely that these don't ever overflow, or they overflow minimally which
 * has no serious effect, but this should be investigated further.
