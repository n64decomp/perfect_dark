/**
 * Path Finding
 *
 * Usage:
 * - The caller calls waypoint_find_closest_to_pos() twice to find the from and to waypoints.
 * - The caller allocates an array of waypoint pointers (typically 6 elements).
 * - The caller calls nav_find_route() with the two waypoints, a pointer to the array and the array length.
 * - nav_find_route() writes the waypoint pointers into the array and returns the number of elements written.
 *
 * If there are more waypoints in the path than the array can fit, only the first <array size> waypoints are written.
 * In this case, the caller should re-run the path finding once some of the path has been traversed to get the next
 * waypoints. However, there is randomness involved in path finding. To ensure the same path is used, the caller can
 * preseed the random number generator for the path finder. It can do this by calling nav_set_seed() with a random
 * seed before calling nav_find_route(), and it should call nav_set_seed() with a zero seed to clear it for the
 * next caller.
 *
 * The algorithm is hierarchical, and uses Dijkstra's algorithm but with a cost of 1 for every segment and breaks ties
 * using randomness.
 *
 * More specifically:
 * Waypoints are grouped into clusters called waygroups. A waygroup might be the same thing as a room, but not
 * necessarily. The algorithm finds the path at the waygroup level, then a path is found through the waypoints in the
 * first group, then the second group, and so on until the results array is full or the destination is reached.
 *
 * To actually find a path, a step number (cost) is assigned to each node until the destination is discovered. It then
 * works backwards from the destination, choosing which node will be the one prior to it by looking for the neighbouring
 * node which is one step lower. If there are multiple nodes to choose from then the selected node will be random.
