/**
 * Room matrices
 *
 * Each room that is rendered needs to have a modelview matrix. The matrix can
 * be pushed onto the displaylist multiple times per frame, even in single player.
 *
 * A simple approach would be to allocate these matrices out of graphics memory
 * as needed, populating and converting them to the RSP's matrix format each time.
 *
 * The solution used here keeps a cache of these matrices. This allows the same
 * matrix to be reused instead of having to allocate, calculate and convert them
 * each time which saves CPU time and memory. However, the game has to spend
 * CPU time keeping track of cache usage so it can free slots, and the cache
 * allocation uses more total memory than on-demand allocations would require,
 * so this system is perhaps not as beneficial as it seems.
 *
 * The cache is implemented using 5 parallel arrays:
 *
 * g_RoomMtxAges
 *  - The number of frames since each cache slot was last used.
 *  - When it reaches 2 the slot is freed.
 * g_RoomMtxLinkedRooms
 *  - The linked room number per cache slot, or -1 if free.
 * g_RoomMtxBaseRooms
 *  - The room that each matrix's position is relative to.
 *  - This is the player's room, as the world is drawn relative to this.
 * g_RoomMtxScales
 *  - The scale that is applied to the matrix. Usually 1.
 * g_RoomMtxMatrices
 *  - The matrices themselves, in the RSP's matrix format.
 *
 * Each room can have at most one matrix slot. When multiplayer is in use, the
 * same room matrix can be used for both players, but only if they have the same
 * global draw offset (ie. are in the same room).
 *
 * When players are not in the same room but can see the same rooms, each
 * player's matrix cache invalidates the other's until they move into the same
 * room or stop looking at each other's rooms.
